Trump shocked the world to become president. </p><p>From Roger Stone, a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, longtime political adviser, friend to Donald Trump, and consummate Republican strategist, comes the first in-depth examination of how Trump's campaign tapped in to the national mood to deliver a stunning victory that almost no one saw coming. </p><p>In the early hours of November 9, 2016, one of the most contentious, polarizing, and vicious presidential races came to an abrupt and unexpected end when heavily favored presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton called Donald J. Trump to concede, shocking a nation that had, only hours before, given little credence to his chances. Donald Trump pulled the greatest upset in American political history despite a torrent of invective and dismissal of the mainstream media. Here is the first definitive explanation about how the \"silent majority\" shifted the election to Donald Trump in reliable Democratic Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, thus handing him the presidency. </p><p>Stone, a longtime Trump retainer and confidant, gives us the inside story of how Donald Trump almost single-handedly harnessed discontent among \"Forgotten Americans\" despite running a guerrilla-style grassroots campaign to compete with the smooth-running and free-spending Clinton political machine. </p><p>From the start Trump's campaign was unlike any seen on the national stage - combative, maverick, and fearless. Trump's nomination was the hostile takeover of the Republican Party and a resounding repudiation of the failed leadership of both parties whose policies have brought America to the brink of financial collapse as well as endangering our national security. </p><p>Here Stone outlines how Donald Trump skillfully ran as the anti-Open Borders candidate as well as a supporter of American sovereignty and how he used the globalist trade deals like NAFTA to win over 3 of 10 Bernie Sanders supporters. The veteran adviser to Nixon, Reagan, and Trump charts the rise of the alt-conservative media and the end of the mainstream media monopoly on voter-impacting information dissemination. This is an insider's view that includes studying opposition research into Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton's crimes and the struggle by the Republican establishment to stop Trump and how they underestimated him.</p>","detailsUri":"/Authors/Roger%20Stone/Books/The%2bMaking%2bof%2bthe%2bPresident%2b2016/Format/MP3-CD%20Unabridged/ISBN/978-1-5436-1473-2","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-1473-2.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":15013552},{"name":"A Merciful Truth","subname":"","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5366-5637-4","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":6.00,"retailPrice":9.99,"classification":{"name":"MP3-CD Unabridged","description":"MP3-CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Mp3","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5366-5637-4.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Teri Schnaubelt","shipDateUtc":"2017-06-06T00:00:00-04:00","length":"10:00:00","hours":10,"audioClipUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/promoclips.brillianceaudio.com/mercifultr33032.mp3","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Kendra Elliot","authorNamesForLink":"Kendra Elliot","summary":"<p>Raised by a family of survivalists, FBI agent Mercy Kilpatrick can take on any challenge—even the hostile reception to her homecoming.

We have selectively bred plants and animals for thousands of years to maximize agricultural production and cater to our tastes in pets. The observation of the creation of artificial animal and plant variants was a key stimulant for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The ability to directly engineer the genomes of organisms first became possible in the 1970s, when the gene for human insulin was introduced into bacteria to produce this protein for diabetics. At the same time, mice were modified to produce human growth hormone, and grew huge as a result. But these were only our first tottering steps into the possibilities of genetic engineering. </p><p>In the past few years, the pace of progress has accelerated enormously. We can now cut and paste genes using molecular scissors with astonishing ease, and the new technology of genome editing can be applied to practically any species of plants or animals. 'Mutation chain reaction' can be used to alter the genes of a population of pests, such as flies; as the modified creatures breed, the mutation is spread through the population, so that within a few generations the organism is almost completely altered. At the same time, scientists are also beginning to synthesize new organisms from scratch. </p><p>These new technologies hold much promise for improving lives. Genome editing has already been used clinically to treat AIDS patients, by genetically modifying their white blood cells to be resistant to HIV. In agriculture, genome editing could be used to engineer species with increased food output, and the ability to thrive in challenging climates. New bacterial forms may be used to generate energy. But these powerful new techniques also raise important ethical dilemmas and potential dangers, pressing issues that are already upon us given the speed of scientific developments. To what extent should parents be able to manipulate the genetics of their offspring - and would designer babies be limited to the rich? Can we effectively weigh up the risks from introducing synthetic lifeforms into complex ecosystems? John Parrington explains the nature and possibilities of these new scientific developments, which could usher in a brave, new world. We must rapidly come to understand its implications if we are to direct its huge potential to the good of humanity and the planet.</p>","detailsUri":"/Authors/John%20Parrington/Books/Redesigning%2bLife/Format/MP3-CD%20Unabridged/ISBN/978-1-5436-1483-1","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-1483-1.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":15009564},{"name":"Rejected Writers Take the Stage","subname":"","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5366-8449-0","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":6.00,"retailPrice":9.99,"classification":{"name":"MP3-CD Unabridged","description":"MP3-CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Mp3","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5366-8449-0.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Tanya Eby","shipDateUtc":"2017-06-06T00:00:00-04:00","length":"08:00:00","hours":8,"audioClipUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/promoclips.brillianceaudio.com/rejectedwr34227.mp3","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Suzanne Kelman","authorNamesForLink":"Suzanne Kelman","summary":"<p>After months of playing the lottery and hoping for an uptick in her dog-boarding business, Janet’s friend Annie must face the inevitable: the bank is foreclosing on her family farm.

Bush exposes the economic, political, and cultural cracks that wealthy nations face and makes the case for transforming those same vulnerabilities into sources of strength—and the foundation of a national renewal</b><p><p>America and other developed countries, including Germany, Japan, France, and Great Britain are in desperate straits. The loss of community, a contracting jobs market, immigration fears, rising globalization, and poisonous partisanship—the adverse price of unprecedented prosperity—are pushing these nations to the brink.<p><p>Acclaimed author, economist, hedge fund manager, and presidential advisor Todd G. Buchholz argues that without a sense of common purpose and shared identity, nations can collapse. The signs are everywhere: Reckless financial markets encourage people to gamble with other people’s money. A coddling educational culture removes the stigma of underachievement. Community traditions such as American Legion cookouts and patriotic parades are derided as corny or jingoistic. Newcomers are watched with suspicion and contempt.<p><p>As Buchholz makes clear, the United States is not the first country to suffer these fissures. In <i>The Price of Prosperity</i> he examines the fates of previous empires—those that have fallen as well as those extricated from near-collapse and the ruins of war thanks to the vision and efforts of strong leaders. He then identifies what great leaders do to fend off the forces that tear nations apart.<p><p>Is the loss of empire inevitable? No. Can a community spirit be restored in the U.S. and in Europe? The answer is a resounding yes. We cannot retrieve the jobs of our grandparents, but we can embrace uniquely American traditions, while building new foundations for growth and change. Buchholz offers a roadmap to recovery, and calls for a revival of national pride and patriotism to help us come together once again to protect the nation and ensure our future.<p>","detailsUri":"/Authors/Todd%20G.%20Buchholz/Books/The%2bPrice%2bof%2bProsperity/Format/CD-U/ISBN/978-1-5226-9081-8","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5226-9081-8.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":15014037},{"name":"Real Artists Don't Starve","subname":"Timeless Strategies for Thriving in the New Creative Age","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5366-9357-7","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":15.00,"retailPrice":24.99,"classification":{"name":"CD-U","description":"CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Cd","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5366-9357-7.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Stu Gray","shipDateUtc":"2017-06-06T00:00:00-04:00","length":"06:00:00","hours":6,"audioClipUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/promoclips.brillianceaudio.com/realartist34536.mp3","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Jeff Goins","authorNamesForLink":"Jeff Goins","summary":"<p><strong>Bestselling author and creativity expert Jeff Goins dismantles the myth that being creative is a hindrance to success by revealing how an artistic temperament is in fact a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</strong></p>\r\n<p>For centuries, the myth of the starving artist has dominated our culture, seeping into the minds of creative people and stifling their pursuits. But the truth is that the world’s most successful artists did <em>not</em> starve. In fact, they capitalized on the power of their creative strength. In <em>Real Artists Don’t Starve</em>, Jeff Goins debunks the myth of the starving artist by unveiling the ideas that created it and replacing them with timeless strategies for thriving, including</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>steal from your influences (don’t wait for inspiration),</li>\r\n<li>collaborate with others (working alone is a surefire way to starve),</li>\r\n<li>take strategic risks (instead of reckless ones),</li>\r\n<li>make money in order to make more art (it’s not selling out), and</li>\r\n<li>apprentice under a master (a “lone genius” can never reach full potential).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Through inspiring anecdotes of successful creatives both past and present, Goins shows that living by these rules is not only doable but it’s also a fulfilling way to thrive.</p>\r\n<p>From graphic designers and writers to artists and business professionals, creatives already know that no one is born an artist.

In fact, success in business and in life flow from a healthy exercise of creativity.</p>\r\n<p>Expanding upon the groundbreaking work in his previous bestseller <em>The Art of Work</em>, Goins explores the tension every creative person and organization faces in an effort to blend the inspired life with a practical path to success.

After all, what wasn't there to like? He was a good listener, generous with his money, a great cook and host, and a hard worker on old Dad Wilbur's place, which he bought for $1,500. He wins the admiration of Sheriff Nat Adare when he quells and befriends the often-wild Charlie Nash and pays for the damages he has caused in the town saloon. The only person in the town that he doesn't win over is the sheriff's niece, Marian Lane, who runs the local grocery and has caused more than her share of heartbreak among the young men of the town. What bothers Marian is that no one can learn anything about Duval or his past, other than that he was a cowpuncher who had worked for a taskmaster on the T Bar Ranch. Marian's curiosity is intensified when Duval runs the thug Larry Jude out of town after he calls Duval a \"boy-killer.\" But Duval's past lands in Moose Creek when Discretion, the horse that he loves, is accompanied from the East by the animal's self-proclaimed groom, Henry. Once Duval learns that Henry, who he had known in New York, plans to stay on in Moose Creek, he warns him not to \"play no tricks.\" Things begin to heat up when Duval attends a dance where he encounters not only Marian but the famous manhunter, Marshal Richard Kinkaid. When a robbery occurs at the same time as the dance, Kinkaid, who has already been baited by Marian to find out who Duval is, promises she will have the answer to her question. So begins a dangerous game of matching wits between Duval and Kinkaid.","detailsUri":"/Authors/Max%20Brand/Books/Daring%2bDuval/Format/CD-U/ISBN/978-1-5047-8891-5","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/9781504788915.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":15002624},{"name":"Dark Echoes of the Past","subname":"","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5436-0157-2","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":19.99,"retailPrice":24.99,"classification":{"name":"CD-U","description":"CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Cd","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-0157-2.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Malcolm Hillgartner","shipDateUtc":"2017-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","length":"08:00:00","hours":8,"audioClipUri":"","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Ramón Díaz Eterovic","authorNamesForLink":"Ramón Díaz Eterovic","summary":"<p><b>The first novel by multiple-award-winning Chilean author Ramón Díaz Eterovic to be translated into English—a landmark event for fans of crime fiction.</b></p><p>Private investigator Heredia spends his days reading detective novels; commiserating with his cat, Simenon; and peering out over the Mapocho River from his Santiago apartment.

Now, in yet another virtuosic performance, the actor proves that despite being separated by a span of over a century, his connection to the author and his work is undeniable and that theirs is a timeless collaboration that should not be missed. Trading in the idyllic banks of Twain's Mississippi for medieval England, Offerman regales listeners with one of American literature's foremost satires and the author's most inventive and darkly funny pieces of fiction. </p><p>Hank Morgan is the archetype of modern man in 19th-century New England: adept at his trade as a mechanic, innovative, forward thinking. So when a blow to the head inexplicably sends him back in time 1300 years and places him in Camelot, instead of despair, he feels emboldened by the prospect placed before him and sets out to modernize and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. But, in order to do so, he'll need to contend with brash nobles, superstitious nincompoops, and a conniving, blowhard wizard. </p><p>While time travel has become a common trope in storytelling today, in Twain's time it was truly a novel idea; all the more imaginative when you consider how it's used for satirical effect. A thinly veiled critique of the political and social institutions that impede progress and a scathing condemnation of the naiveté that allows them to thrive, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> saw Twain's biting wit and sharp tongue honed to a fine point.</p><p>Told primarily through Hank's first-person perspective, Offerman effortlessly captures the Yankee's straightforward, matter-of-fact gruffness. Like Offerman - whose woodworking skills are the stuff of legend - Hank is a natural builder of things and his can-do, by-the-bootstraps spirit finds its vocal foil in Offerman's crisp delivery. But it's in Offerman's ability to convey the myriad characters and absurdities Hank faces that makes this an incomparable listening experience: the flowery embellishments and insane braggadocio of knights; the lilting, feathery sing-song of Clarence; the garrulous, long-winded pomp of the aristocracy; the old, dithering windbag pronouncements of Merlin. Offerman plays each of these with a humor and humanity that Twain himself would have enjoyed.</p>","detailsUri":"/Authors/Mark%20Twain/Books/A%2bConnecticut%2bYankee%2bin%2bKing%2bArthur%2527s%2bCourt/Format/MP3-CD%20Unabridged/ISBN/978-1-5436-6754-7","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-6754-7.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":14999677},{"name":"Deadly Lies","subname":"","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5436-6743-1","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":11.99,"retailPrice":14.99,"classification":{"name":"MP3-CD Unabridged","description":"MP3-CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Mp3","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-6743-1.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Emily Cauldwell,Kevin Stillwell","shipDateUtc":"2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","length":"10:00:00","hours":10,"audioClipUri":"","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Chris Patchell","authorNamesForLink":"Chris Patchell","summary":"<p>As a teenager, Jill Shannon fell victim to her stepfather's cruel abuse.
