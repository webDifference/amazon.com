<br>
<div> 
On both Amazon-owned and operated sites and unaffiliated sites, Amazon 
displays interest-based advertising using information you make available
 to us when you interact with our sites, content, or services. 
Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or 
targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities 
such as purchasing on our sites, visiting sites that contain Amazon 
content or ads, interacting with Amazon tools, or using our payment 
services, like Checkout by Amazon. <a href="//www.amazon.com/gp/aw/help/id=468496">Click here</a>
 for more information about the types of information that we gather.  In
 providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles 
for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising 
Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer 
advocacy organizations).  
</div>
<br>
<div>
Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known 
as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies 
(collectively, “cookies”). Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you
 see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites and 
other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant
 ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful 
not to show you the same ones repeatedly. We do not associate your 
interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you 
with interest-based ads. 
</div> 
<br>
<div>
We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third 
party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers 
and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving 
companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that 
users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are 
part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for 
example, users in the Pacific Northwest who bought or browsed for 
classical music). Also, some third-parties may provide us information 
about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or 
demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use
 to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.  
</div> 
<br>
<div>
Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use 
technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites directly to your 
browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. 
They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and 
to personalize ad content.  We do not have access to or control over 
cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may 
use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party 
websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Interest-Based 
Ads page.  Please contact them directly for more information about their
 privacy practices. 
</div> 
<br>
<b>Advertising Preferences</b>
<br>
<div>
Amazon offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. 
You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from Amazon. You will 
still see ads but they will not be personalized. Please visit your <a href="//www.amazon.com/adprefs">Advertising Preferences</a> page to learn how to set this preference. 
</div> 
<br>
<div>
You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third 
party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a> or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
