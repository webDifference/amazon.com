Australian forces defended our long shoreline against the threat of invasion and more than 500,000 Australians went into battle overseas. They fought on the dusty soil of the Middle East and North Africa, in the snow-topped hills of Greece, on the beaches of the Pacific and in the sweltering jungles of Malaya and New Guinea. And the first ABC war correspondents were on the frontlines with them.\r\n<p><p>The story of these correspondents is a story of Australians at war and a tale of personal struggle, humor, tragedy, and achievement. From Chester Wilmot’s gripping accounts of the Siege of Tobruk to Dudley Leggett trekking with the diggers through the mud of the Kokoda Trail, Haydon Lennard helping to free Australian nurses from a Japanese prison camp and John Elliott’s shocking death in the final campaign in Borneo, ABC correspondents shared the highs, lows, and the dangers of the frontline with the troops. And the photographs of the correspondents in the field and the ephemera that has survived: the torn pages, blotted, crossed out, and hastily typed scripts that are reproduced in the book bring these experiences to life. Tony Hill’s own experience as a foreign correspondent led him in search of the first ABC war correspondents and to a compelling and largely untold story.

From his townhouse in Bern, and in clandestine meetings in restaurants, back roads, and lovers' bedrooms, Dulles met with and facilitated the plots of Germans who were trying to destroy the country's leadership.

From the early days of raw corn liquor to the myriad distilleries that have proliferated around the country today, bourbon has come to symbolize America. In <i>Bourbon: The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of an American Whiskey</i>, award-winning whiskey author Fred Minnick traces bourbon's entire history, from the 1700s with Irish, Scottish, and French settlers setting up stills and making distilled spirits in the New World through today's booming resurgence. He also lays out in expert detail the critical role this spirit has played throughout the cultural and even political history of the nation - from Congress passing whiskey-protection laws to consumers standing in long lines just for a glimpse of a rare bottle of Pappy Van Winkle. And most importantly, Minnick explores the mystery of who most likely created the sweet corn liquor we now know as bourbon.

That was the first time she saw a ghost. Now the city of Boston is being terrorized-someone is kidnapping women and burying them alive, but cruelly leaving a glimmer of hope for the authorities by sending a clue about their location. Vickie is pulled into the investigation when her name is mentioned in one of the notes. And as a historian, she has the knowledge to help uncover the graves the killer known as the Undertaker is choosing. But she also has another, unique lead: the spirit of one of the victims is appearing to her in dreams. Special Agent Griffin Price is on the case for the Krewe of Hunters, the FBI's special unit for paranormal investigators. He feels particularly protective of Vickie since their shared past is connected to the threat that currently surrounds them. With the killer accelerating his plans, time is running out for more victims hidden around the city. Vickie is becoming closer with Griffin, but she's getting too close to the danger, and every breath could be her last.

In this ground-breaking book, recognized evangelical Bible professor Wayne Grudem rejects five mistaken views about Christian influence on politics: (1) “compel religion,” (2) “exclude religion,” (3) “all government is demonic,” (4) “do evangel-ism, not politics,” and (5) “do politics, not evangelism.” He proposes a better alternative: (6) “significant Christian influence on government.”<p><p>Then he explains the Bible’s teachings about the purpose of civil government and the characteristics of good or bad government. Does the Bible support some form of democracy? Should judges and the courts hold the ultimate power in a nation? With respect to specific political issues, Grudem argues that most people’s political views depend on deep-seated assumptions about several basic moral and even theological questions, such as whether God exists, whether absolute moral standards can be known, whether there is good and evil in each person’s heart, whether people should be accountable for their good and bad choices, whether property should belong to individuals or to society, and whether the purpose of the earth’s resources is to bring benefit to mankind.<p><p>After addressing these foundational questions, Grudem provides a thoughtful, carefully-reasoned analysis of over fifty specific issues dealing with the protection of life, marriage, the family and children, economic issues and taxation, the environment, national defense, relationships to other nations, freedom of speech and religion, quotas, and special interests. He makes frequent application to the current policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, but the principles discussed here are relevant for any nation.<p>","detailsUri":"/Authors/Wayne%20Grudem/Books/Politics%2b-%2bAccording%2bto%2bthe%2bBible/Format/CD-U/ISBN/978-1-5436-0469-6","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-0469-6.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":14939385},{"name":"Predator","subname":"A Novel","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5436-0471-9","stockStatus":"Backordered","finalPrice":15.00,"retailPrice":22.99,"classification":{"name":"CD-U","description":"CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Cd","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-0471-9.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Cassandra Campbell","shipDateUtc":"2017-05-30T00:00:00-04:00","length":"09:00:00","hours":9,"audioClipUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/promoclips.brillianceaudio.com/predator34940.mp3","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Terri Blackstock","authorNamesForLink":"Terri Blackstock","summary":"<p><b>Bestselling author Terri Blackstock presents another stand-alone novel, <i>Predator</i>.</b><p><p>The murder of Krista Carmichael’s fourteen-year-old sister by an online predator has shaken her faith and made her question God’s justice and protection.

Even though he had been in and out of the Amish community over the past year, Anna was certain he would soon commit to the Amish faith by baptism, and she ignored the rumors about him. </p><p>When Anna's cousin visits, Anna has a chance to see her life through someone else's eyes. Anna discovers her parents hope she'll marry Stephen Baker, a friend of her brother's who was constantly at the house. Stephen and Anna disagreed about the issue of mining in the area and each were determined to make the other see sense. Feeling Stephen is too old and not as much fun as Levi, Anna avoids him as she has always done, until her cousin intervenes. Gradually, as she spends more time with the two men, Anna learns what's important to her in a husband. </p><p>When the two men have different stories regarding a rumor, will Anna be able to figure out which one she can trust? </p><p>After one man breaks her heart, will she find love with the other, or has she left it too late? </p><p>Other books in the Amish Misfits series: Book 1, <i>The Amish Girl Who Never Belonged</i>; Book 2, <i>The Amish Spinster</i>; Book 4, <i>The Amish Single Mother</i>.

Now, in yet another virtuosic performance, the actor proves that despite being separated by a span of over a century, his connection to the author and his work is undeniable and that theirs is a timeless collaboration that should not be missed. Trading in the idyllic banks of Twain's Mississippi for medieval England, Offerman regales listeners with one of American literature's foremost satires and the author's most inventive and darkly funny pieces of fiction. </p><p>Hank Morgan is the archetype of modern man in 19th-century New England: adept at his trade as a mechanic, innovative, forward thinking. So when a blow to the head inexplicably sends him back in time 1300 years and places him in Camelot, instead of despair, he feels emboldened by the prospect placed before him and sets out to modernize and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. But, in order to do so, he'll need to contend with brash nobles, superstitious nincompoops, and a conniving, blowhard wizard. </p><p>While time travel has become a common trope in storytelling today, in Twain's time it was truly a novel idea; all the more imaginative when you consider how it's used for satirical effect. A thinly veiled critique of the political and social institutions that impede progress and a scathing condemnation of the naiveté that allows them to thrive, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> saw Twain's biting wit and sharp tongue honed to a fine point.</p><p>Told primarily through Hank's first-person perspective, Offerman effortlessly captures the Yankee's straightforward, matter-of-fact gruffness. Like Offerman - whose woodworking skills are the stuff of legend - Hank is a natural builder of things and his can-do, by-the-bootstraps spirit finds its vocal foil in Offerman's crisp delivery. But it's in Offerman's ability to convey the myriad characters and absurdities Hank faces that makes this an incomparable listening experience: the flowery embellishments and insane braggadocio of knights; the lilting, feathery sing-song of Clarence; the garrulous, long-winded pomp of the aristocracy; the old, dithering windbag pronouncements of Merlin. Offerman plays each of these with a humor and humanity that Twain himself would have enjoyed.</p>","detailsUri":"/Authors/Mark%20Twain/Books/A%2bConnecticut%2bYankee%2bin%2bKing%2bArthur%2527s%2bCourt/Format/MP3-CD%20Unabridged/ISBN/978-1-5436-6754-7","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-6754-7.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":14929846},{"name":"Deadly Lies","subname":"","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5436-6743-1","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":11.99,"retailPrice":14.99,"classification":{"name":"MP3-CD Unabridged","description":"MP3-CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Mp3","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/978-1-5436-6743-1.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Emily Cauldwell,Kevin Stillwell","shipDateUtc":"2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","length":"10:00:00","hours":10,"audioClipUri":"","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Chris Patchell","authorNamesForLink":"Chris Patchell","summary":"<p>As a teenager, Jill Shannon fell victim to her stepfather's cruel abuse.

He accepts it without consulting his wife, and buys a magnificent, irresistibly underpriced historic Pacific Heights mansion as their new home. Shocked by an earthquake the night they arrive, the past and present suddenly collide for them in the elegant mansion filled with tender memories and haunting portraits. The original inhabitants suddenly appear for a few brief minutes. In the ensuing days, they meet the large and lively family who lived there a century ago: distinguished Bertrand Butterfield and his gracious wife Gwyneth, their sons Josiah and little Magnus, daughters Bettina and Lucy, formidable Scottish matriarch Augusta and her eccentric brother Angus.\r\nAll long since dead. All very much alive in spirit?and visible to the Gregorys and no one else. The two families are delighted to share elegant dinners and warm friendship. They have much to teach each other, as the Gregorys watch the past unfold, while living their own modern-day lives. Within these enchanted rooms, it is at once 1917 and a century later, where the Gregorys realize they have been given a perfect gift?beloved friends and the wisdom to shape their own future with gratitude and grace from a fascinating past. Past Perfect is Danielle Steel at her bewitching best, a novel for the ages. \r\n\r\n\r\n","detailsUri":"/Authors/Danielle%20Steel/Books/Past%2bPerfect%2b/Format/CD-U/ISBN/978-1-5019-7366-6","bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/9781501973666.jpg","subgenre":null,"id":14939135},{"name":"A Place at Our Table","subname":"","books":[{"internationalStandardBookNumber":"978-1-5414-0943-9","stockStatus":"In Stock","finalPrice":34.39,"retailPrice":42.99,"classification":{"name":"CD-U","description":"CD Unabridged","fileFormatType":"Cd","lengthType":"Unabridged","sortOrder":0},"bookCoverUri":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/imagestore.brillianceaudio.com/images/itm_img/9781541409439.jpg","isMissingBookCover":false,"narratorName":"Callie Beaulieu","shipDateUtc":"2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","length":"12:00:00","hours":12,"audioClipUri":"","allowPurchasing":true}],"authorNames":"Amy Clipston","authorNamesForLink":"Amy Clipston","summary":"Along with his volunteer work at the local fire department, running his Amish farm keeps Jamie Riehl busy.
